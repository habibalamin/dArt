        <p>'dart' is a simple, non-interactive command line tool to fetch artwork from Apple's servers. It supports songs, music videos, movies, short films, TV shows, iBooks, audiobooks, OS X/iOS apps and podcasts. It is in alpha stage right now, and the code is quite frankly embarassing (more in issues section), but it works (when Apple's servers return something, which is not always true - nothing I can do about that, see the issues below).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Only uses standard libraries from Python 2.6 - tested on Python 2.7.2</li>
<li>Download artwork at full resolution from Apple's servers!</li>
<li>Supports songs, music videos, albums, movies, short films, TV shows, audiobooks, iBooks, iOS/OS X software and podcasts.</li>
<li>Non-interactive - can be called from scripts</li>
<li>Can look up track by iTunes ID for exact matches</li>
<li>Can filter explicit media</li>
</ul><h2>Screenshots</h2>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>'dart' is written completely in Python, but cannot be installed by pip or easy_install at this point. Installation is completely manual, just drag the single 'dart' file to any of your paths. No man page as of yet, but <code>dart -h</code> prints a help message. You may need to <code>chmod +x dart</code> to make the app executable.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre><code>dart -id LOOKUPID [-c ISOCODE] [-dl DOWNLOADLOCATION]
      -s SEARCHTERM [-c ISOCODE] [-m MEDIATYPE] [-dl DOWNLOADLOCATION] [-fe]
</code></pre>
