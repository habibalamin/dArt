{"note":"Don't delete this file!

It supports songs, music videos, movies, short films, TV shows, iBooks, audiobooks, OS X/iOS apps and podcasts. It is in alpha stage right now, and the code is quite frankly embarassing (more in issues section), but it works (when Apple's servers return something, which is not always true - nothing I can do about that, see the issues below).\r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n* Only uses standard libraries from Python 2.6 - tested on Python 2.7.2\r\n* Download artwork at full resolution from Apple's servers!\r\n* Supports songs, music videos, albums, movies, short films, TV shows, audiobooks, iBooks, iOS/OS X software and podcasts.\r\n* Non-interactive - can be called from scripts\r\n* Can look up track by iTunes ID for exact matches\r\n* Can filter explicit media\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n#### Downloading \"Dr. Who\" Artwork! ####\r\n![Downloading \"Dr. Who\" Artwork!](http://f.cl.ly/items/0C2F2b191S1i1m2O1M2z/dlDrWhoArt.png)\r\n#### Working! ####\r\n![Working!](http://f.cl.ly/items/322c210P0f0S3p3Y2N0f/dlDrWhoArt_working.png)\r\n#### Progress! ####\r\n![Progress!](http://f.cl.ly/items/1q3N1L0f220k2g2e3z2R/dlDrWhoArt_progress.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\n'dart' is written completely in Python, but cannot be installed by pip or easy_install at this point. Installation is completely manual, just drag the single 'dart' file to any of your paths. No man page as of yet, but ```dart -h``` prints a help message. You may need to ```chmod +x dart``` to make the app executable.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n```\r\ndart -id LOOKUPID [-c ISOCODE] [-dl DOWNLOADLOCATION]\r\n\t  -s SEARCHTERM [-c ISOCODE] [-m MEDIATYPE] [-dl DOWNLOADLOCATION] [-fe]\r\n```\r\n## Issues ##\r\n* Can't search all metadata, only supports country, media type, search term, iTunes ID and explicit filter.\r\n* A lot of items don't return their artwork, even though they do have them. This is an issue on Apple's part, there's nothing I can do about it. The user is warned about which images aren't downloaded. During testing, I noticed that one of the images that had worked a few times stopped working after repeated testing on that image, while all other working images were still working.\r\n* Error messages go to stdout, instead of stderr.\r\n* Can't narrow search for TV shows by episode, except with iTunes ID. Without the exact ID, it will show all episodes of TV show corresponding to search term.\r\n* Doesn't use getopt - which I just found out about after implementing the options accepted and couldn't be bothered to change it after - and a lot of lazy patching together. This should change with the next version, when I have to add more options.","google":"","tagline":"iStore Art Downloader - download artwork at full resolution from Apple's servers."}
